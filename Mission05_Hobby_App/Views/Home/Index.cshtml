    <h1 class="display-4">Welcome to my trail running site!</h1>
    <p>Trail running is an incredible way to stay active while immersing yourself in nature, offering both physical and mental benefits that go beyond a typical workout. The soft, uneven terrain reduces the impact on your joints compared to pounding pavement, helping to prevent common road-running injuries. As you weave through trees, climb hills, and navigate winding paths, you engage a variety of muscles, improving strength, balance, and endurance. Beyond the physical perks, trail running is a powerful way to clear your mind—free from traffic, noise, and daily stressors, you can focus on the rhythm of your breath and the beauty of the outdoors. Whether it's the fresh air, the peaceful solitude, or the sense of adventure, hitting the trails leaves you feeling refreshed, recharged, and ready for whatever comes next.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">During my time at BYU, trail running has been one of my favorite ways to escape the stresses of school and clear my head. There’s something about heading into the mountains, away from deadlines and exams, that brings a sense of freedom and renewal. I’ve loved exploring trails all across Utah, from the breathtaking red rock landscapes of Capitol Reef and Zion to the rugged mountain peaks near Provo. Whether it's a solo run to reset my mind or an adventure with friends, trail running has given me the perfect mix of challenge and fun. Some of my favorite memories have been pushing myself in trail races, feeling the thrill of the competition while surrounded by stunning scenery. The combination of exercise, exploration, and great company has made trail running an unforgettable part of my college experience.</p>
    <p>Imagine leaving behind the noise of the city and stepping onto a winding dirt path surrounded by towering trees, open ridgelines, or breathtaking red rock canyons. Trail running is more than just exercise—it’s an adventure. Unlike the repetitive pounding of pavement, trails offer ever-changing terrain that keeps things exciting, challenging your body in new ways while protecting your joints from harsh impact. It’s a chance to breathe in fresh mountain air, hear nothing but the crunch of dirt beneath your feet, and feel a deep connection with nature. Whether you’re chasing a sunrise over a quiet peak or racing through a lush forest with friends, trail running is an experience that refreshes both body and mind. If you’re looking for a way to get fit, clear your head, and explore the world around you, there’s no better place to start than the trails.</p>
